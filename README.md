# Svelte/Sapper app w/ JWT Auth

Used the default template for setting up a [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) project. 

The main purpose of this project was to give me an understanding on how to implement authentication using JSON web tokens. For the purpose of this project I also built a basic news/post style application with scoring. 

This project is not a complete app but more a proof of concept for me with JWTs.


If I were to improve this:
- Add tests for robustness
- Implement better sorting/categorisation/searching for posts
- Clean up UI
